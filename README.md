Online advertising system
=======

The project is a simulation of online advertising. All the logic is implemented in PL/SQL. Java 
is used only for reading the input from a file and passing it to the procedures and finally writing 
the output from tables to a file. The projec does the following:

- Greedy algorithm, balance algorithm and generalized balance algorithm to decide 
  which advertisers should come up for a particular search query
- First price and second price auction algorithms on the above mentioned algorithms
